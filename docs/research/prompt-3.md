# Prompt: Music Data Formats and Ecosystem Integration

Research music data formats, interoperability standards, and ecosystem integration features that a comprehensive music analysis toolkit should support. I need findings on:

## Scope

1. **Music notation formats:** MusicXML (current version and capabilities), MEI (Music Encoding Initiative), ABC notation, LilyPond format, Humdrum `**kern`. Which are most important for interoperability?
2. **MIDI advances:** MIDI 2.0 specification — what's new, what capabilities does it add? MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression). Is MIDI 2.0 adoption happening?
3. **Music data standards:** JAMS (JSON Annotated Music Specification), ChordLab format, RomanText format, `**kern` format
4. **Integration with DAWs and notation software:** What formats/protocols do MuseScore, Finale, Sibelius, Dorico, Ableton, Logic use for data exchange?
5. **Web Audio and Web MIDI:** Current state of Web MIDI API, Web Audio API integration possibilities for a music analysis library
6. **OSC (Open Sound Control):** Is OSC support valuable for a music toolkit?

## Search Queries

- "MusicXML parsing JavaScript 2025"
- "MIDI 2.0 specification features adoption"
- "music notation format comparison MusicXML MEI"
- "Web MIDI API current support 2025"
- "music data interchange formats standard"
- "JAMS music annotation format"

## Deliverable

For each format/standard, assess: **adoption level**, **complexity to implement**, and **value to users** of a symbolic music analysis library.
