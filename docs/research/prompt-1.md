# Prompt: Music Analysis Library Landscape Research

Research the current landscape of music analysis libraries and toolkits (2024–2026). I need detailed findings on:

## Scope

1. **JavaScript/TypeScript music libraries:** tonal.js, tone.js, music21j, teoria, tonejs, sharp11, scribbletune, opensheetmusicdisplay. What features do they offer? What are their strengths?
2. **Python music analysis libraries:** music21, librosa, pretty_midi, midiutil, mingus, abjad, partitura. What capabilities do they have that are considered essential for music analysis?
3. **Academic/research tools:** Humdrum, music21, JAMS, mir_eval, essentia. What analysis capabilities do serious musicologists expect?

## Search Queries

- "music analysis library features comparison 2025"
- "computational music theory toolkit features"
- "music information retrieval library comparison"
- "tonal.js features API"
- "music21 python features capabilities"
- "JavaScript music theory library 2025"
- "MIR music information retrieval essential algorithms"

## Deliverable

For each library found, list its key features/capabilities that would be relevant to a symbolic music analysis toolkit (not audio DSP). Focus on what features are considered **table-stakes** vs. **differentiating**.
