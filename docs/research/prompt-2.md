# Prompt: Cutting-Edge Symbolic Music Analysis Techniques

Research cutting-edge techniques and high-value features in music information retrieval (MIR) and computational musicology that operate on symbolic music data (MIDI, scores — NOT audio). I need findings on:

## Scope

1. **Harmonic analysis advances:** Neo-Riemannian theory, Tonnetz representations, harmonic network analysis, functional harmony beyond Roman numerals, chord-scale theory
2. **Voice leading algorithms:** Tymoczko's geometric voice-leading spaces, efficient voice leading, parsimonious voice leading
3. **Rhythm and meter:** Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM), metrical well-formedness rules, rhythmic complexity measures, groove quantification
4. **Form and structure:** Self-similarity matrices, novelty detection, structural segmentation, repetition analysis
5. **Tension and expectation models:** Lerdahl's Tonal Pitch Space, MIDI-based tension models beyond Plomp-Levelt, Huron's expectation theory (ITPRA), information-theoretic surprise
6. **Counterpoint and polyphony:** Species counterpoint rule checking, polyphonic stream analysis, textural analysis
7. **Generative/transformational theory:** Pitch-class set transformations, serial operations (retrograde, inversion, rotation), twelve-tone matrix generation
