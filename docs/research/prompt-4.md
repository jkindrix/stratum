# Prompt: Modern and Emerging Music Analysis Features

Research modern and emerging features that would make a music analysis toolkit stand out in 2025–2026. Focus on symbolic music (not audio DSP). I need findings on:

## Scope

1. **Music embedding and similarity:** Pitch-class set similarity measures, earth mover's distance for chord comparison, cosine similarity for harmonic profiles, musical distance metrics
2. **Graph-based music analysis:** Chord transition graphs, harmonic networks, Tonnetz graph operations, pitch-space navigation
3. **Statistical music analysis:** Distribution analysis of intervals/pitches/durations, Zipf's law in music, entropy measures, Markov chain analysis of chord progressions
4. **Style analysis:** Computational style classification, feature extraction for style comparison, corpus analysis tools
5. **Serialist and post-tonal techniques:** Twelve-tone row operations, combinatoriality, all-interval series, set-class multiplication, Boulez's frequency multiplication
6. **Algorithmic composition utilities:** Constraint-based composition helpers, Markov chain generators, L-system music, cellular automata for music, stochastic processes
7. **Microtonality and xenharmonics:** Beyond simple N-TET — rank-2 temperaments, MOS scales, Scala format support, xenharmonic lattices
8. **Music visualization:** Beyond piano-roll — Tonnetz visualization, pitch-space plots, circle of fifths, interval class vectors as radar charts, form diagrams, Schenkerian notation aids
